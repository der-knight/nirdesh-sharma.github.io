I am a research scholar at [Hydrosense Labs](https://hydrosense.iitd.ac.in/team/) at [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://iitd.ac.in). I completed my Bachelor's in Civil Engineering from [National Institute of Technology Hamirpur](https://nith.ac.in). During my  Masters at [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in) I received the [DAAD-KOSPIE](https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/?detail=57504697)  scholarship for a research stay of 7 months at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp). I am currently a SERB OVDF fellow at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html).

# Research Statement
My goal is to develop solutions that enhance societal resilience against natural hazards. I use a combination of artificial intelligence, satellite imagery and physics based models to ascertain the drivers of natural hazards and devise preventive measures. I have developed mutiple automated and easy to use tools for floods and  landslides namely [ILSM](https://nirdesh-sharma.github.io/publication/ILSM), [DeepSARFLOOD](https://nirdesh-sharma.github.io/publication/DSF), [ML-CASCADE](https://nirdesh-sharma.github.io/publication/ML-CASCADE), and [ILCD](https://nirdesh-sharma.github.io/publication/ML-CASCADE).
